# Cub3D - 3D Game Engine 🌟

## 📘 Project Overview
Cub3D is a 3D game engine project developed as part of the curriculum at 42.
The goal is to create a simple 3D game using the principles of raycasting, allowing players to navigate through a 3D environment. 
This project focuses on implementing the basics of 3D rendering and user interaction.

## 🛠️ Features

- Raycasting engine for 3D rendering.
- Player movement and view control.
- Support for textures and colors in the environment.
- Simple map parsing for level design.
- Basic lighting effects.
- Minimap functionality for navigation.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- C: The game engine is implemented in C for performance.
- MinilibX: A graphical library used for rendering.
- Raycasting: Technique used for rendering the 3D environment.
- Makefile: For build automation.
